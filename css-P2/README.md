## Stretch Goals

The exercises in the following links will help you get more practice with CSS selectors, CSS Flexbox, and optionally Grid.

### Exercise 11

Go back to exercise 10 and make the button do a 360deg rotation when it bounces

![exercise-10 bonus goal](./__1-lecture/assets/ex-10-goal-bonus.gif)

- Use the syntax `transform:scale() rotate()` in your keyframe

### Exercise 12 - NO flexbox!

The very first exercise had us build this:

![exercise-1 goal](./__1-lecture/assets/ex-1-goal.png)

For fun, try and build this _without_ using flexbox. No `display: flex` allowed.

You will need to use `calc()` and `vh` units for this.

Example use: `min-height: calc(10vh + 200px);`

### Exercise 13

Create an HTML file and a CSS file that outputs the following

![exercise-13 goal](./__1-lecture/assets/ex-13-goal.png)

```html
<div class="alert alert-primary">
  <p>A simple primary alert.</p>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-secondary">
  <p>A simple secondary alert.</p>
</div>

...
```

### Exercise 14

Create an HTML file and a CSS file that outputs the following

![exercise-14 goal](./__1-lecture/assets/ex-14-goal.png)

```html
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary">Secondary</button>

...
```

Note: The `type="button"` attribute isn't important for this exercise

### Exercise 15

Create an HTML file and a CSS file that outputs the following

Build upon what you did in exercise 14.

![exercise-15 goal](./__1-lecture/assets/ex-15-goal.png)

```html
<button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary">Primary</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-secondary">Secondary</button>

...
```

Note: The `type="button"` attribute isn't important for this exercise

### Exercise 16

Create an HTML file and a CSS file that outputs the following

Build upon what you did in previous exercise 14 and 15.

#### Part 1

![exercise-16 goal 1](./__1-lecture/assets/ex-16-goal-1.png)

#### Part 2

#### Part 3

![exercise-16 goal 3](./__1-lecture/assets/ex-16-goal-3.png)

## Notes

- You do not need to re-create the code snippets. Your goal is to create the buttons. The code snippets are shown in the screenshots as an example of what the HTML properties should be.
- The `type="button"` attribute isn't important for this exercise
