# Exercise 7: Screen Readers (stretch)

We tackled keyboard navigation, but screen readers are a bit of a different ballgame.

Follow the example on this page:

HINT: Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the different elements.

Try and use the Typeahead exclusively through your computer's screen reader. Your task will be complete when you can select items from the typeahead without looking at your screen.

Screen readers:

- Windows: NVDA, https://www.nvaccess.org/download/
- MacOS: VoiceOver, built into the computer
- Linux: Orca, https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/
