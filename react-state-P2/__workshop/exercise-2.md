# Exercise 2: Showing and picking suggestions

When the user types in the input, we want to check and see if any of the suggestions match.

Here are some rules:

## It should be case insensitive

Given a title "The Girls":

✅ "The"
✅ "the"

## It should look for matches anywhere in the word

Given a title "The Girls":

✅ "The"
✅ "the G"
✅ "irls"
⛔️ "The Guys"

## The user should have entered at least 2 letters

Given a title "The Girls":

✅ "The"
✅ "Th"
⛔️ "T"

Start by trying to render a list of the matches below the input:

![working demo](../__lecture/assets/unstyled-filtered-items.png)

Most of these results have the word "the" in them explicitly. The third item, "Technically Wrong", has it hidden in the word "oTHEr".

You should use a `<ul>` and `<li>`.

> HINT: You'll want to use `filter` to shrink the list of suggestions, and then use `map` to render an `<li>` for each matched result.

Next, we'll need to be able to tell when the user selects one of the suggestions. There are two ways this can happen:

- The user can click on one of the suggestions
- The user can press "Enter" on their keyboard to select the currently selected suggestion.

We'll solve that second case a little further on. For now, let's add a hover state and an `onClick` event. This event should call the `handleSelect` prop with the current suggestion's title.

Give this a shot, and then take a look at the hint for how we decided to do it.

After you have the logic working, add some styles to match the mockup. You can add a subtle yellow background on hover to indicate which option is selected:

> *If you are color blind and cannot see the color yellow, you can use another color. Whatever color you choose make sure it is pale so as to not hide the selected text.*

To do this, you'll want to use styled-components. You can create a new `Suggestion` component:

```jsx
// Inside your component, replacing the `<li>`:
<Suggestion key={suggestion.id} onClick={() => handleSelect(suggestion.title)}>
  {suggestion.title}
</Suggestion>;

// further down:
const Suggestion = styled.li`
  // styles here, including hover styles.
`;
```
