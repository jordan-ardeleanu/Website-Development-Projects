# Exercise 5 - Tell me a Joke

_This exercise is a continuation of the bot chat from exercise 4._

If the user says "something funny", the bot should ask if the user wants to hear a joke. It should also explain that it will wait for `YES` or `NO`.

- If the user says `YES`, the bot tells a joke and asks if the user wants another.
- If the user says `NO`, the bot says goodbye...

_Find some "clean" jokes online. You could build an array of a few jokes that the bot can use to send to the user._
