## ‚ö° Exercises

In the last workshop, we built a Cookie Clicker game. Today we'll be updating it.

One of the hardest parts of being a developer is dealing with changing requirements. Often you'll have built a wonderful, functional app, and then a product manager will say "actually, we want to move this bit of functionality to _after_ the signup flow", and implementing that change can be challenging.

In this workshop, several new requirements have been added!

This workshop also introduces **React context**. This part of the problem takes the shape of a more typical guided workshop, but it comes afterwards.

### Starting point

For your convenience, an initial version of the last workshop's base solution is provided. If you'd prefer, you can definitely keep working on your version though!
