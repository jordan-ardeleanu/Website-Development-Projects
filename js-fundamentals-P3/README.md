## 🦉 Lecture

You will find a markdown version of today's lecture in the `__lecture` folder.

If you would like to preview the markdown files as slides, you will need to install this extension: [marp-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode). After which, doing "Preview" will render slides similar to those viewed in the lecture.
