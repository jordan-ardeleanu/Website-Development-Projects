_\* stands for Humongous Database._

- No **normalization** data: i.e. spreading across many tables
- No Schema
- No need for complex SQL join commands.

---

- Stores data together in a document
- Gives us lots of flexibility
- Allows you to get started before the exact bd requirements are known.
- Ability to adapt and improve later.

Data is stored a **Document** in a **Collection** in a **Database**
