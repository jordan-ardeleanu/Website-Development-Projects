# Introduction to MongoDB

## Setup

```
yarn install
```

## Setup MongoDB Atlas Account

For the MongoDB workshops, we will be using mongoDB Atlas. It is a cloud DB service.

Go to [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and click **Try Free** to signup.

Use the google signin to accelerate the process.

1. Sign up with Google

2. Create an organization, call it whatever you like

![mongo_org](__lecture/assets/step-2-org.gif)

3. Create a project, call it whatever you like

![mongo_project](__lecture/assets/step-3-project.gif)

4. Build a cluster
- Select the free tier
- Accept default settings
- Create a user by adding a username and password under `How would you like to authenticate your connection?`
- Add your current IP Address by clicking on `Add My Current IP Address` under `Where would you like to connect from?` 
    - (this may take a while)
- Once your IP Address is loaded in, click on `Finish and Close` then `Go to Database`
- **⚠️ WAIT FOR THE BLUE BAR TO DISAPPEAR BEFORE MOVING ONTO STEP 5 ⚠️** 
    - The blue bar is MongoDB applying all the changes we just made. It will take a few minutes.

5. Create a Database
- Click on `Browse Collections`
- Click on `Add My Own Data`
- Create a database called `exercise_1`
- Create a collection called `users`

6. Get the connection key
    - Click on `Connect`
    - Click on `Connect your application`
    - Copy the connection string. It will look something like this.

```
    mongodb+srv://rony:<password>@cluster0.tjwvx.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

![mongo_connect](__lecture/assets/step-6-connect.gif)

- Create a `.env` file in the root of the project
    - Right click, select `New File` and simply call it `.env`
- Add the connection string to that file under the name MONGO_URI: 

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://rony:<password>@cluster0.tjwvx.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

**Replace `<password>` and `myFirstDatabase` with actual values.**

- `<password>` is the password you assigned to the user you created in step 4
- `myFirstDatabase` is the name of the database (See exercise-1.1)

**Example**
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://rony:superAmazingPassword1@cluster0.tjwvx.mongodb.net/superCoolDatabaseName?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```
