# OOP

---

What does this program do?

```js
const createAcc = () => {
  return { sum: 0 };
};

const inc = (item) => {
  item.sum = item.sum + 1;
};

const a = createAcc();
const b = createAcc();

inc(b);

console.log(a.sum);
console.log(b.sum);
```

## What is OOP?

- The OOP paradigm consists of structuring your code around classes
- To know OOP is to know classes
- A way to structure your program
- Some people hardly ever use it, others use it _everywhere_.

---

## Why you should learn OOP

OOP is really good for one thing: user interface libraries.

- React
- Vue
- Angular
- Standard Android UI library
- Standard iOS UI library

But what is a user interface library? _more on that soon_

## What is a class?

Class is yet another type.

Wait. What other types do you know?

```js
// How do we "create" these types?
```

---

## Defining a class

```js
class Car {}
```

---

## First Rule of classes: `new`

If Car is a class, then we can use the `new` keyword to create a new object of that type.

```js
class Car {
  … // stuff goes here
}
const myCar = new Car();
const yourCar = new Car();
```

---

## Second Rule of classes: `constructor`

`new` also calls the `constructor` of the class.

_The `this` keyword refers to the new object._

```js
class Car {
  constructor(brand) {
    this.brand = brand;
  }
}

const myCar = new Car("Toyota");
const yourCar = new Car("Honda");
```

---

```js
class Country {
  constructor(pop) {
    this.population = pop;
  }
}

const canada = new Country(30000);
const usa = new Country(400000);
```

---

```js
class City {
  constructor(p, n) {
    this.potholes = p;
    this.name = n;
  }
}

const montreal = new City(30000, "Montreal");
const sanFransisco = new City(3, "San Fransisco");

// What does the following output?
console.log(montreal);
console.log(sanFransisco);
```

---

## Third Rule of classes: method arrow functions

Every method arrow function of a class creates a function.
Every instance of a class has a property that matches the method name and refers to the function.

```js
class Car {
    noise = () => {
        console.log("Vrooom");
    }
}

const mazda = new Car();

mazda.noise();
```

---

```js
class School {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  noise = () => {
    console.log("...The sound of students learning...");
  };
}

const concordiaBootcamps = new School("Concordia Bootcamps");

// What does the following output?
concordiaBootcamps.noise();

// What do I have to type to output the name?
```

---

```js
class Dog {
  constructor(voice) {
    this.voice = voice;
  }

  noise = () => {
    console.log("woof");
  };

  coolOff = () => {
    console.log("pant");
  };
}

const mastiff = new Dog();
const terrier = new Dog();
```

---

## Fourth Rule of classes

The context of the newly created functions is the newly created object.
In other words, the keyword `this` refers to the newly created object.

---

```js
class Dog {
  constructor(voice) {
    this.voice = voice;
  }

  noise = () => {
    console.log(this.voice);
  };

  coolOff = () => {
    console.log("pant ");
  };
}

const mastiff = new Dog("WOOF!");
const terrier = new Dog("yip!yip!");
```

---

```js
class Car {
  constructor() {
    this.mileage = 0;
  }

  drive = () => {
    this.mileage = this.mileage + 10;
  };
}

const myCar = new Car();
console.log("Mileage before driving: " + myCar.mileage);
myCar.drive();
console.log("Mileage after driving: " + myCar.mileage);
```

### Exercise

```js
// Exercise 1
// 1. Given this class, how would we represent its hunger level?
// 2. How could we represent varying hunger levels based on activity?
// 3. How about when it eats?
class Animal {}
```

---

```js
// Exercise 2
// 1. Track happiness, strength and hunger
// 2. What happens when a "Human" exercises, dances, eats?
class Human {}
```

---

```js
// Exercise 3
// 1. What happens when we create a "new Human"
// 2. Happiness, strength and hunger aren't the same for each person.
// 3. What someone eats will affect their hunger differently. How can we handle this?
class Human {}

const Arnold = new Human();
const Jerry = new Human();
```

---

## ⚠ Warning! ⚠

Using `const` or `let` does not work inside a class.

```js
class Book {
    constructor() {
        this.title = "Mary had a little lamb";
        const pages = 50;
        let hardCover = false;
    }
}

console.log(new Book()); 
```

---

## Inheritance

A class can _inherit_ from another class.

---

```js
class Human {
  constructor() {
    this.species = "Homo Sapien";
  }

  dance = () => {
    console.log("disco time");
  };
}

// Declare a class that extends Human
class Male extends Human {
  constructor(name) {
    super(); // call parent constructor to set the species
    this.name = name;
  }

  greet = () => {
    console.log("I'm " + this.name);
  };
}

// Create a bob object that is a HUMAN MALE
const bob = new Male("Bob");
```

---
