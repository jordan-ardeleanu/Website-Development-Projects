## ‚ö° Exercises

_Unless specified in the exercise, don't worry about the fonts. Some of the screenshots were taken on Linux and the base system font is a little different._

### Exercise 1

- Open the provided index.html file in the browser.
- Modify the `style.css` file to match the following image

![exercise-1 goal](./__1-lecture/assets/ex-1-goal.png)

- background color is `blue`
- properties used: `padding`, `border`, `background`, `color`, `border-radius`.
  - HINT: you need to _remove_ the default border.

```

### Exercise 4

The style.css file contains errors. Modify that file, and only that file, to produce the following output:

![exercise-4 goal](./__1-lecture/assets/ex-4-goal.png)

---

### Exercise 5

The style.css file has been corrupted. Repair the CSS so that the page matches the image below.

![exercise-5 goal](./__1-lecture/assets/ex-5-goal.png)

_No modifications to the HTML file._

---

### Exercise 6

Add the CSS needed to reproduce this page.

![exercise-6 goal](./__1-lecture/assets/ex-6-goal.png)

The exact measurements are not needed. Try and estimate the values (colors, font-sizes, etc).

---

### Exercise 7

Complete both the HTML and CSS files to reproduce the following web page:

_It isn't necessary to make it pixel perfect._

![exercise-7 goal](./__1-lecture/assets/ex-7-goal.png)

---

### Exercise 9

Update the CSS file to reproduce the following:

![exercise-9 goal](./__1-lecture/assets/ex-9-goal.png)

- The cat is moved to the top left of the screen.
- The alpaca stays at the top left of the screen but must appear on top of the cat image.
- The dog must be in the center of the screen.
- The whales must be moved to the bottom right of the screen.

### Exercise 10 - Stretch

Using CSS, create a button that animates on hover:

![stretch-1 goal](./__1-lecture/assets/stretch-1-goal.gif)

- It should color to a dark-blue when focused. It should **not** have the typical "focus ring" (blue outline on MacOS, dotted outline on Windows).
- It should shrink when the mouse is held down on it.
- It should be animated

### Necessary properties/techniques

- You'll need the `:active` and `:focus` pseudoselectors
- You'll also need to use the `transform: scale` property for the size change, and the `transition` property for the animation.
- You can disable the outline with `outline: none`, but **you should only do this if you have an alternative focus state**. That outline is very important for keyboard users, to know which element is focused.
