# The Concordia Bootcamps Hello API

The base url of the API is `https://journeyedu.herokuapp.com`.

## Usage

Use the [request-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request-promise) module to make requests to this API. Take some time to read the their docs. (_Note that this module, and the `request` module are deprecated but still very much relevant and in-use. You can read about it [here](https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142)._)

This API follows the REST principles.

It uses [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) language codes to classify the data. Although, when adding a new "ficticious" language, the code doesn't not need to conform to this. (Code can be whatever you like.)

### Persistence

There is not _real_ persistence to the data that you add. It will remain in memory on the server as long as the server is not restarted. It is not restarted on any specified schedule, but expect that data entered today might not exist tomorrow.
