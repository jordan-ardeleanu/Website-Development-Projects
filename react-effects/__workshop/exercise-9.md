# Exercise 9: Increased pricing

In Cookie Clicker, each time you buy an item, it gets more expensive. The first cursor might only cost 10 cookies, but the second one will cost 12, and then 15, and then 18, etc... The price goes up by 25% cookies every time. 

Implement this! (Round down any decimals)
