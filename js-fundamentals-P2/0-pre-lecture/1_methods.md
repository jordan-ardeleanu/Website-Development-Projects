# Fundamentals: JavaScript Methods

Methods have to be the most exciting part of JavaScript!

- Methods are special functions that reference the values of the data stored in the object.
- Methods are called with dot notation `object.method(arguments)`. _The period between object and method is the dot in dot notation._

> Because ALL of the data types we've learned about are actually objects, they all have a bunch of built-in methods and special properties.

For example, all objects have `toString` methods.

```js
let num = 3;
num.toString(); // "3"

let bool = true;
bool.toString(); // "true"

let str = "hello";
str.toString();
("hello");

let arr = [1, 2, "three"];
arr.toString(); // "1,2,three"

let dip = { value: 3 };
dip.toString(); // "[object Object]"
```

That last one is weird and we'll address it in a later lecture. Suffice it to say that the method does exist, and does do _something_.

- When programming with JavaScript we don't generally care that booleans, numbers and functions are objects. Their methods aren't that useful most of the time.

- The most helpful built-in methods are on strings, arrays and object. _We'll talk more about objects and their methods later when we talk about creating our own methods._

## String Methods

Strings have a bunch of methods and properties that will be immediately useful. üòâ

- `.length`
- `.replace()`
- `.slice()`
- `.concat()`
- `split()`
- `indexOf()`

üìù None of these methods **mutate** the string; strings are **immutable**.

üìù They return a new version of the string which you can then work with as you like.

In the following examples, write out the expected outcome of each `console.log()`. _We will go over some of your answers in class._ Feel free to click on the method to open it's info page on w3 schools.

### [`.length`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsreF/jsref_length_string.asp)

`.length` is a property that holds the # of characters in the string.

```js
// Example 1
const sentiment = "I love programming";
console.log(sentiment.length); // 18
```

---

### [`.replace()`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsreF/jsref_replace.asp)

The `.replace()` method replaces a specified value with another value in a string.

It takes 2 parameters, the value to replace and the new value.

```js
// Example 2.1
const food = "I love bacon";
food.replace("bacon", "avocado");
console.log(food); // I love bacon

// Example 2.2
const newFood = food.replace("bacon", "avocado");
console.log(newFood); // I love avocado
```

What is the difference between `2.1` and `2.2`? _Calling a string method will not change the original string as it is **immutable**._ If you want to console the transformed string, you have to either assign the value to a new variable (as we did above) or call the method inside of th `console.log()` as we will do in the next example.

---

### [`.slice()`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsreF/jsref_slice_string.asp)

`.slice()` extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.

- The method takes 2 parameters: the start position, and the end position.

```js
// Example 3
const sentence = "Bingo was his name.";
console.log(sentence.slice(0, 9)); // Bingo was
```

---

### [`.concat()`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsreF/jsref_concat_string.asp)

The `.concat()` method is used to join two or more strings.

```js
// Example 4
let partOne = "Do or do not.";
let partTwo = "There is no try.";
console.log(partOne.concat(partTwo)); // "Do or do not.There is no try"

// Can you get a space into there, between the 2 parts, without changing the original strings?
// console.log(partOne.concat(" " + partTwo));
```

---

### [`.split()`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsreF/jsref_split.asp)

The `.split()` method "split" a string into an array of _substrings_.

```js
// Example 5
const truth = "The greatest teacher, failure is.";
console.log(truth.split(",")); // ?
console.log(truth.split(", ")); // ?
console.log(truth.split(" ")); // ?
```

---

### [`.indexOf()`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsreF/jsref_indexof.asp)

The `.indexOf()` method returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string.

This method returns -1 if the value to search for never occurs.

```js
// Example 6
let yodaSpeak =
  "Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.";
const darkSideIndex = yodaSpeak.indexOf("dark side");
const jediIndex = yodaSpeak.indexOf("jedi");

console.log(darkSideIndex, jediIndex); // 
```

ü§î*Why does JavaScript decide to return `-1` instead of some other value? like `0`?*

## Array Methods

- Arrays have a bunch of methods attached to them.
- Many of which you'll use on a daily basis.

### Common Array methods

### [`.concat()`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsreF/jsref_concat_array.asp)

The `.concat()` method returns a _new_ array with the values of two existing arrays.

```js
// Example 7
const arrayOne = ["think", "dream", "learn", "write"];
const arrayTwo = ["thought", "dreams", "knowledge", "truth"];

let newArray = arrayOne.concat(arrayTwo);
console.log(newArray); // ?
```

### [`.join()`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsreF/jsref_join.asp)

The `.join()` method returns the array as a string.

```js
// Example 8
const lexicon = [
  "The",
  "large",
  "shaggy",
  "dog",
  "barked",
  "at",
  "the",
  "silence",
];

let sentence = lexicon.join();
console.log(sentence); // ?

// Can you improve the outcome of this?
```

There are many many more array methods. Here are a few that you should look up and become familiar with. We will go over them together in class.

- `.includes()`, `.slice()`
- `.indexOf()`, `.push()`
- `.pop()`, `.sort()`
- `.shift()`, `.unshift()`
- `.reverse()`, `.lastIndexOf()`
- `.splice()`, `.toString()`

## Exercises

Turn an input string into another string

---

```js
// Exercise 1
const longSentence = "I am a really long sentence, look how many words I have!";
longSentance.slice(19,37)
// output: "sentence, look how"
```

```js
// Exercise 2
const greeting = "Hi world!";
greeting.replace("Hi", "Hello")
// output: "Hello world!"
```

---

```js
// Exercise 3
const age = "I am 23 years old!";
age.replace("23 years ", "")
// output: "I am old!"
```

```js
// Exercise 4
const ask = "How are you today?";
ask.split(" ")
// output: ["how", "are", "you", "yesterday?"]
```
