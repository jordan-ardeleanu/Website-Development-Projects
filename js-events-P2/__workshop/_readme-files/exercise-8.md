# Exercise 8 - Password suggest

If the user enters a password which is too short, suggest a random password for them!

You can do this by creating a big list of nouns, and selecting 4-5 of them at random. You can use `Math.random()` to get a random number between 0 and 1, and `Math.round()` to round a decimal number.
